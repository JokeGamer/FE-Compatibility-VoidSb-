# FE-Compatibility

This will translate traditional LocalScripts to be compatible with the new FE requirements.

Instructions:

    2: Paste the link of your script where it says [[PASTE LINK HERE]]
  
    3: Run as a normal Script.


Features:

    Sandbox: Server-Sided Sandbox to treat itself like it was a LocalScript.
  
    Replication: Automatically creates Events to replicate input from Client.
